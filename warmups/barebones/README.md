Bare Bones Warm-Up: 

Our task was to create a bare bones HTML page, and include a link to a stylesheet. We also needed to create the stylesheet file so there are no broken links. We were not asked to include any styling within our stylesheet. Our HTML needed to include a title tag, a first-level header that says anything you want, and a paragraph that also says anything you want.
