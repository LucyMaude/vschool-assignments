Enemy Generator Warm-Up: 
    We were asked to create an "enemy generator" to practice using constructor functions and objects. Each enemy needed to have a type chosen from one of three names at random, an amount of hitPoints chosen randomly based on the type of enemy, and a defense worth 3 times the enemy's hit points. We needed to generate 100 enemies using our constructor function.
