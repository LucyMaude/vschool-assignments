Another Castle Warm-Up:

In this warm-up we were asked to create an object with a number of properties. Some properties needed to be functions, some strings, some booleans. We were then asked to create a random range function, the result of which would call one of three function properties in our object. The last requirement was to print to the console pieces of our objects that may have been impacted by one of our three functions.
