Penguins vs. Communists Project: 

The assignment for this project was to use Javascript to determine the outcome of a conflict between two parties. The project requirements are as follows:
    Create two parties using a constructor function (w/ name and population)
    Flip a coin (random number between 1 and 2) to see which party attacks first
    Create a function called sendNuke(party, onHit, onMiss) where:
        the first parameter party is the Javascript object of the party that will be attacked
        the second parameter onHit is a callback function that will be called if the attack is successful
        the third parameter onMiss is a callback function that will be called if the attack is unsuccessful
    Print messages in the callbacks that are appropriate
    A random algorithm will be used to determine if the attack is a miss or a hit (this can happen in the sendNuke function
    If an attack is successful initiate a random damage amount
    After an attack is completed (or missed) the opposing party will initiate an attack.
    This process will repeat until one of the parties reaches a 0 population
The goal of the project is to demonstrate understanding of: Objects/Associative Arrays, Constructors or "Classes", Callback functions, Functional programming concepts.
