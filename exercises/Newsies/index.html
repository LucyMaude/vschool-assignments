    <h1>Passing the Time</h1>
    <h2>Excerpts From Dune</h2>
    <p id=f loater> The following are excerpts taken from <b>Frank Herbert's</b> novel <i>Dune</i> (1965). Enjoy <u>Passing the Time</u> while reading these!</p>
    <p class="chunky-monkey">"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain." </p>
    <p class="chunky-monkey">“Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.”</p>
    <p class="chunky-monkey"> “The mind can go either direction under stress—toward positive or toward negative: on or off. Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive end. The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by training.” </p>
